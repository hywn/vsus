# vsus exports
quick lists of various groups' vlives with subs info

## groups
- [idle](https://hywn.github.io/vsus/browser?jurl=json/idle.json)

## info
i use short scripts which scrape a group's namu page for vlive links. use vsus to get video info (including subs). store in big json file.

JSON files can be browsed with `browser.html` (see links above)

## notes
- a lot of groups' namu pages have extra nice info like which members appeared in vlive. didn't scrape because takes work but maybe can include one day
- most groups' namu pages will list out specifically live broadcasts, which is what i want. some do not, though (at least separately) (e.g. fromis), so is just big list of videos.
